<p>IU Journalism is accredited by the Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC), which reviews its program every six years.  Receiving accredited status is an indication that the Schoolâ€™s courses for journalism majors are addressing the <a href="http://www.journalism.ku.edu/acejmc-professional-values-competencies" target="_blank">values and competencies</a> established by the ACEJMC.</p>


<p>The list of twelve values and competencies can generally be applied in total to J360, however the following five are particularly important to achieve for the course:</p>


<ul>
<li>Understand concepts and apply theories in the use and presentation of images and information;</li>
<li>Think critically, creatively and independently;</li>
<li>Write correctly and clearly in forms and styles appropriate for the communications professions, audiences and purposes they serve;</li>
<li>Critically evaluate their own work and that of others for accuracy and fairness, clarity, appropriate style and grammatical correctness;</li>

<li>Apply tools and technologies appropriate for the communications professions in which they work.</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="Goalsetting">Goalsetting</h2>




<p>Some great portfolios convey dominance in a particular area and others showcase the power of fusing talents together. In our first week, I would like you to think about your academic and professional career up to this very moment, assess where you are, and where you want to go. How will your portfolio get you there? Who is your target audience and what do you want to convey? </p>




<h2 id="Assignments">Important Dates</h2>


<p>Assignment deadlines and quiz dates are listed below. They are all due on the date listed at 11:59pm. Make certain to read each assignment carefully to see whether or not classmate feedback is required. Please understand that I <strong>do not accept&nbsp;late assignments</strong>. If you fail to submit by the deadline, you will not receive credit for the assignment. Feedback assignments are an especially critical element in this course. The strict policy on assignment deadlines aims to ensure that each student receives equal feedback and an excellent chance of producing a quality portfolio. Missed assignments not only hurt your grade, but also your classmates&#8217; ability to develop a portfolio website.</p>
