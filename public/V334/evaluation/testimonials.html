<h2>What did you like most about this course and instructor?</h2>
<br>
<p>&#8220;Professor Koop is very knowledgable on this subject matter and was always available to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I simply can't say enough good things about Andy Koop. Personable, knowledgeable about the subject matter and always willing to sit down and address any concerns you may have. If I'm not mistaken this is the first time this class has been offered. I believe this particular course is essential to the overall journalism curriculum. The knowledge I was able to gain and the finished web portfolio I was able to walk away with as I set out to tackle the "real world" in NYC are invaluable.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;His experience and ability to give us feedback and help with our portfolios&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Koop was extremely helpful and made the course challenging and worthwhile. He was always available to
help students, which is very rare for an online course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There were times I was confused and frustrated and may not have been the most decent student to deal with, but the
professor did a good job of explaining and being professional. Thank you for that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is very nice and always available for help and doesn't get frustrated!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really liked the online aspect of it and that we did not have to meet in a classroom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really liked how encouraging Mr. Koop was to all of the students. He was always there to help if we had questions, and
even gave feedback. I really appreciated seeing a teacher that values his students.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I liked being able to choose our own theme and I also liked the availability and openness of the instructor. You could, for
the most part, add any plugins or features that you desired.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I really liked how available and helpful Andrew was to his students if they needed help or had questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It gave me the chance to create my own website and develop a good portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was very helpful when I did not understand something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My favorite part of this course was learning more about WordPress and that at the end we had a complete,
professional-quality portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Andrew was very available to answer any questions and solve any problems you may have run into.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was very available and open when it came to asking questions regarding assignments. He was very creative with
the group chat Q&A session, which was wonderful and provided me with great insight regarding my final project. His
assignments were very clear and straightforward. He made a great effort in making himself available for any and all
questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The website we created is something that can directly effect us after the course is finished. The instructor was always
willing to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Andrew was very helpful and promptly responded to any questions I sent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That it helped contribute to my professional development.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was designed really clearly. I took a different online course before and it was always hard to find the readings etc. but
this one was easily organized.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Koop is super friendly and helpful so I was never nervous about asking questions. I like the help session
assignment because it was nice to be able to ask all of my questions one-on-one. Also, at first I was just taking it
because my friend told me it was fun and not too hard, but I actually see the value in creating an online portfolio now. It
would be great to include your link in resumes to employers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I enjoyed how knowledgeable and passionate Andrew was and how willing he was to work with students especially
when we do not meet for class. I liked how much flexibility we had in what we make of our portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He gave suggestions even when I did not ask&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is amazing and always there to help in an instant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Willingness to help and explain.  Gives a response to the question, and then a resource for additional information.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The course was very flexible. We got to choose our own website themes and how we wanted to change those themes. Professor Koop was ALWAYS available for help - whether by email or in person, which was incredibly helpful and reassuring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I liked the convenience and "at-your-own-pace" approach, and Andrew is very positive, encouraging, and helpful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Always easy to reach and clear which is absolutely essential and necessary when teaching an online course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Koop was extremely helpful and resourceful during this class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Professor Koop was an incredible teacher. He was always willing to take time out of his day to help me and was completely understanding and accomidating when necessary. He was very passionate and offered great suggestions and advice. He was one of the best professors I have had thus far.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was very helpful and understanding when trying to figure out everyone's individual problems.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Available at all times for consulting and advice, always made a point to let students know to contact him with any questions&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Andy was very very helpful throughout the semester! If I had an issue, he was quick to respond and help solve my problems! I loved having Andy as an instructor for this class.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was very invested in the student learning and really helped us learn how to work out problems on our own in a prompt manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The instructor was very helpful throughout the semester.  When emailed with questions, the instructor would quickly answer respond to them, and even add more suggestions and helpful tips to go along with my question.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is very knowledgeable about the subject and genuinely cares about helping his students produce the best work that they are capable of and are proud of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Koop is always available for email consulting and office hours. I like the accessibility of his teaching methods, as this is one of the reasons I enjoy online classes anyways. &#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;His overall willingness to help and interest in our success.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The instructor is obviously strong in html and he knows what he is teaching.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;one on one direction!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;he's very patient with the students &#8221;</p>

<!-- NEW -->

<p>&#8220;I really appreciated his willingness to meet with students! He always emphasized that we was available to meet in person if we needed extra help. Overall, his availability and response time when emailing was outstanding. He is very understanding and takes the extra time to help his students reach solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prof Koop was always available, which I found to be really important in an online course. He was more than fair and understanding, and helped lead me to the right solutions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was easy to get in contact with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The availability of the instructor despite the fact the course was online. Professor Koop was always available to give advice and to help as best as he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Extremely nice and patient with students. Very knowledgable on all topics and great at getting information across.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How helpful our professor was to constantly help when we needed it. He was also very quick to respond to emails.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;always available and would answer questions almost immediately; really passionate about what he does and helping students&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How friendly and willing/passionate to teach Andrew is is amazing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Answers questions quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I liked the wordpress infrastructure being introduced.&#8221;</p>
